# Personal React Portfolio
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

## Description
Hello and welcome to my new and updated portfolio! This repo is the source code for my personal portfolio which I created using React and Tailwind. It was and is my next step after completing the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp as a practical application of the skills and technologies that I learned (at least for front-end development). The domain is hosted by Google and constantly updated for personal use.
