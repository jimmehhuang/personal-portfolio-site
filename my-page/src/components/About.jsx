            </div>
                <p>I graduated from UT Austin in 2017 with a BA in Sociology. Since then, I mostly
                actually wandered around the medical field- from EMT work, to scribing in an outpatient clinic, to working in
                an ophthalmology clinic as a technician. I decided to switch career paths to software out of vague interests in
                coding and made the jump in 2022!</p>
                <br/>
                <p>My hobbies include video games, obstacle course races, swimming, 
                and playing the guitar for church events! I also like to travel and explore new places, 
                foods, and sights whenever possible.</p>
